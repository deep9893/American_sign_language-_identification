# American_sign_language-_identification

This projects goal is developing a deep learning model able to identify American Sign photos, so in the future we can automatically identify those signs and help deaf people communicate. IÂ´m using a Kaggle dataset containing 2515 photos showing all digits from 0 to 9 and all alphabet letters from a to z.
